## What are spatial data?

> - One could argue that all data is spatial, because how can one observe something that is _not_ somewhere?

> - However, only data for which the location of observation is registered, referenced, and of (some) relevance for the information contained is considered _spatial data_

## Overview

* data structures vs. data concepts
* the software landscape
* work flows; file formats
* handling attributes (properties) of geometries, 
* plotting maps, 
* measurement units and coordinate reference systems, 
* spatiotemporal data, raster and vector data cubes
 
## data structures vs. data concepts

* data structures: how we represent data in the computer (or on paper)
* data concepts: what we mean by these representations

Example data structure: a vector, array, or list

Example data concept: an object, an event, a field or coverage, a trajectory, an administrative division, outcome of an election, a hurricane. We will come back to this.

## Simple features 
See  https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2018/RJ-2018-009/

Simple features are (a data model for) **things** that have a **geometry** and **properties**.

Simple feature geometry refers to the geometry of a simple feature.

The _simple_ refers to lines (and polygon boundaries) being represented by points connected with straight lines.

For some things, this "thing data model" either works

* **badly**: _continuously_ varying spatial properties, like air temperature
* **moderately well**: categorical/discrete properties varying continuously over space, such as land use

## The common geometries

* `POINT (0 1)`
* `MULTIPOINT (0 1,1 1,-1 2)`
* `LINESTRING (0 0,1 1)`
* `MULTILINESTRING ((0 0,1 1),(2 2,0 2))`
* `POLYGON ((0 0,3 0,3 3,0 3,0 0),(1 1,2 1,2 2,1 2,1 1))`
* `MULTIPOLYGON (((0 0,1 0,1 1,0 1,0 0)),((2 2,3 2,3 3,2 3,2 2)))`
* `GEOMETRYCOLLECTION(POINT(0 1), LINESTRING(0 0,1 1))`
* `POINT EMPTY`

These encodings are called _Well-known text_ (WKT)

## Binary encodings for foreign I/O

Well-known binary (WKB):
```{r echo=TRUE}
library(sf)
st_as_binary(st_as_sfc("POINT (0 1)"))[[1]]
st_as_binary(st_as_sfc("LINESTRING (0 0,1 1)"))[[1]]
```

-----

WKB:

* I/O but also to GDAL, GEOS and liblwgeom
* I/O (direct) to databases, 
* not human readable, but
* fast, and lossless

## Representation in R (by `sf`):
```{r echo=TRUE}
str(st_as_sfc("POINT (0 1)")[[1]])
str(st_as_sfc("LINESTRING (0 0,1 1,2 2)")[[1]])
```

* `POINT` is a numeric vector
* a point set is a `matrix` (1 point per row)
* a set of anything else is a `list`
* classes disambiguate identical storage form (e.g. `LINESTRING` and `MULTIPOINT`, or `POLYGON` and `MULTILINESTRING`)

## `sf` class system

* single feature geometry: `sfc`
```{r}
class(st_linestring(rbind(c(0,0), c(1,1))))
```
* _set_ of single feature geometries: `sfc` (keeps bbox, CRS)
```{r}
class(st_sfc(st_point(c(0,1)), st_point(c(5,5)), crs = 4326))
```
* _set_ of single features (geom + attributes): `sf`
```{r}
class(st_sf(attr = "a", geom = st_sfc(st_point(c(0,1)))))
```

-------

```{r, out.width = "800px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("nc1.png")
```

-------

```{r, out.width = "800px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("nc2.png")
```

-------

```{r, out.width = "800px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("nc3.png")
```

-------

```{r, out.width = "800px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("nc4.png")
```

-------

```{r, out.width = "800px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("horst.jpg")
```

## Empty geometries

Empty geometries reflect a missing geometry. E.g.
```{r echo=TRUE}
st_intersection(st_point(c(0,1)), st_point(c(2,2)))
```
* "there is no geometry for which ..."
* these are important for _type safety_
* unclear why they are typed: what makes an empty point different from an empty linestring? 

## Mixes: 1. at the _single_ feature level:
```{r}
gc = st_union(st_point(c(0,1)), st_linestring(rbind(c(0,0), c(1,1))))
gc
st_sf(attr = "a", geom = st_sfc(gc))
```

## Mixes: 2. at the feature _set_ level:
```{r}
g = st_sfc(st_point(c(0,1)), st_linestring(rbind(c(0,0), c(1,1))))
st_sf(attr = c("a", "b"), geom = g)
```


## Operations on geometries 

Geometry operations can be:

* **predicates**: return `TRUE` or `FALSE`, e.g. `st_intersects`
* **measures**: return a measure (value, possibly with unit), e.g. `st_area`
* **geometry generating** operations, e.g. `st_intersection`

They have an arity:

* *unary*: operates on a single geometry, e.g. `st_area`
* *binary*: operates on a pair, e.g. `st_overlaps`
* *n-ary*: operates on a set, e.g. `st_intersection`

Chapter 5 of [Spatial Data Science](https://keen-swartz-3146c4.netlify.com/geommanip.html) details all the combinations.

If this all looks complicated, do compare it to how a GIS works.


## the R spatial package landscape: from sp to sf

The "sp stack" (2005-...) : sp, rgdal, rgeos, raster, ... (sp: 550 revdeps)

The sf stack (2016-...): sf, stars, mapview, tmap, gstat, spdep, ... (sf: 150 revdeps)

## sp vs. sf

comparison:

* sf can, sp cannot combine geometry types in a `GEOMETRY`
* sf can, sp cannot return `GEOMETRYCOLLECTION`
* sf can, sp cannot handle empty geometries
* sf can, sp cannot distinguish between `POLYGON` and `MULTIPOLYGON` etc.
* sp has an ambiguous data model for holes in polygons, sf doesn't
* sp's `SpatialXxxDataFrame` objects are not `data.frames`, and as a consequence, sp objects do not work well with `tidyverse` commands
* `geom_sf`: sf has full `ggplot2` support

## moving between sp and sf

```{r}
geom = st_sfc(st_point(0:1), st_point(1:2), crs = 4326)
x = st_sf(attr = c("a", "b"), geom = geom)
library(sp)
x.sp = as(x, "Spatial") # sf -> sp
x2 = st_as_sf(x.sp) # and back: sp -> sf
all.equal(x, x2, check.attributes = FALSE)
```

* This works for objects that _can_ be converted, and gives an error otherwise.
* `LINESTRING` and `POLYGON` return as `MULTILINESTRING` and `MULTIPOLYGON` respectively.

## the sf dependency landscape

```{r, out.width = "800px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("sf_deps.png")
```

## Exercise  (1)

* use the dataset found in `system.file("shape/nc.shp", package="sf")`
* Read this dataset with `sf::st_read` (or `sf::read_sf`)
* plot the dataset, then plot the second attribute
* try to manipulate the color scheme and color breaks
* plot the first 20 features of the dataset
* create a plot with axes
* what is the coordinate reference system of the dataset?
* For the `nc` dataset, compute the area of the polygons with `st_area`
* compare the areas with the `AREA` field in the dataset; is there a discrepancy?
* select the polygon that intersects with `POINT (-81.49826 36.4314)`
* Repeat the above steps (or similar ones) with a dataset of your own

## workflows

Typical workflow:

* read: load data from external files or database
* compute: carry out computations
* write: export results (new data "layers", summary statistics, figures)

Recommended:

* put everything in an R script
* _even better_: also put comments in the R script
* _much better_: work from R-Markdown files, write executable documents

## workflows without side effects

Avoid side effects (anything _not_ in the script/R Markdown file):

* **NEVER** read .RData file at startup (rstudio option; `R --vanilla`)
* **NEVER** write .RData at end (rstudio option; `R --vanilla`)
* do not put side effects options in .Renviron / .Rprofile (I use it for graphics options or user credentials)

## Reproducible workflows

* avoid using `setwd()`, at all times
* avoid using `rm(ls())` at the start of the script, but assume a clean workspace
* put all `library(xxx)` statements at the start
* work in a single directory (+subdirectories if needed)
* put a .Rproj rstudio project file in the directory
* zip the directory to share/archive/backup, including the result (html/pdf)

So your colleague (or later self) can:

* open the zip file
* open the .Rproj file
* open the .Rmd file, and click `knit`

## `sessionInfo()`

R and R package versions matter. Use
```
sessionInfo()
```
or 
```
devtools::session_info()
```
at the end of every .Rmd file so that it is documented which version of everything was used. This may help diagnosing issues later on.

## attributes of geometries 

```{r,echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow = c(1,2), mar = rep(0,4))
d <-
list(x = c(-80.889136129435, -80.8880981895369, -80.8496944133074,
-80.7863800795236, -80.7542039426827, -80.7147622265551, -80.7095725270646,
-80.6628652316503, -80.6109682367456, -80.5673747610256, -80.5248192252037,
-80.5071742469361), y = c(36.355154117235, 36.3835838008419,
36.4237198247575, 36.437934666561, 36.4237198247575, 36.4462963382101,
36.4914493651151, 36.5232237173817, 36.5332577233606, 36.5315853890307,
36.5391108935149, 36.5533257353184))

nc = read_sf(system.file("gpkg/nc.gpkg", package="sf"))
#a = st_normalize(st_geometry(nc[3,]))
a = st_geometry(nc[3,])
plot(a, col = 'yellow')
bb = st_bbox(a)
lines(cbind(d$x, d$y), lwd = 2, col = grey(.6))
legend(bb[1], bb[4], c("limestone", "road"), c('yellow', NA), lwd = c(NA,2))
plot(a, col = 'orange')
legend(bb[1], bb[4], "Pop. density: 1.7 / km^2", 'orange')
lines(cbind(d$x, d$y), lwd = 2, col = grey(.6))
```

* what is the bedrock type along the grey road?
* what is the population density along the grey road?

## support of data

* a lot of data is not registered for time _instances_ or spatial _points_, but rather for time _periods_, and/or spatial _areas_, referred to as _support_ of the data
* one can argue that all observation _must_ refer to periods/areas, because observation takes time and space, but that doesn't help much
* making the support explicit may help avoid making meaningless analyses

## attribute-geometry relationships
```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
nc = read_sf(system.file("gpkg/nc.gpkg", package="sf")) %>%
		select(CNTY_, BIR74)
st_agr(nc) = c(CNTY_ = "identity", BIR74 = "aggregate")
pt = st_as_sfc("POINT (-81.49826 36.4314)", crs = st_crs(nc))
i = st_intersection(st_sf(geom = pt), nc)
```
------

We don't get this warning if none of the attributes is an `aggregate`; we're faking this by
```{r}
st_agr(nc) = c(CNTY_ = "identity", BIR74 = "constant")
i = st_intersection(st_sf(geom = pt), nc)
```

## plotting maps 

* plotting spatial data: base, `ggplot2::geom_sf`, raster/stars, mapview, tmap

## measurement units and coordinate reference systems 

* attributes: ordinal, nominal, interval, ratio
* reference sytems: units of measurement, datums, coordinate reference systems, calendars, ontologies, ...

## coordinate transformations 

* `st_crs()` shows, or sets, the coordinate reference system
* `st_transform()` takes care of these, using PROJ strings or EPSG codes (numbers), e.g.

```{r}
nc = read_sf(system.file("gpkg/nc.gpkg", package="sf"))
nc.tr = st_transform(nc, 2264)
st_crs(nc.tr)
st_crs(nc.tr)$units
```

## Raster data

* `sp` has some elementary infrastructure for this (in-memory)
* package `raster` is scalable, solid, and has a large functionality
* `raster` data model: single raster layers, or a stack of raster layers, possibly time-referenced (max: 3-D).
* package `stars` tries to break out of this limitation, and covers raster _and_ vector data cubes
* a challenge is always out-of-core computation (data on disk); generic implementation that is still performant is difficult
* e.g. doing time series analysis on NetCDF files series, with one time instance per NetCDF file

raster grid types

```{r echo=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(stars))
x = 1:5
y = 1:4
d = st_dimensions(x = x, y = y, .raster = c("x", "y"))
m = matrix(runif(20),5,4)
r1 = st_as_stars(r = m, dimensions = d)

r = attr(d, "raster")
r$affine = c(0.2, -0.2)
attr(d, "raster") = r
r2 = st_as_stars(r = m, dimensions = d)

r = attr(d, "raster")
r$affine = c(0.1, -0.3)
attr(d, "raster") = r
r3 = st_as_stars(r = m, dimensions = d)

x = c(1, 2, 3.5, 5, 6)
y = c(1, 1.5, 3, 3.5)
d = st_dimensions(x = x, y = y, .raster = c("x", "y"))
r4 = st_as_stars(r = m, dimensions = d)

grd = st_make_grid(cellsize = c(10,10), offset = c(-130,10), n= c(8,5), crs=st_crs(4326))
r5 = st_transform(grd, "+proj=laea +lon_0=-70 +lat_0=35")

par(mfrow = c(2,3))
r1 = st_make_grid(cellsize = c(1,1), n = c(5,4), offset = c(0,0))
plot(r1, main = "regular")
plot(st_geometry(st_as_sf(r2)), main = "rotated")
plot(st_geometry(st_as_sf(r3)), main = "sheared")
plot(st_geometry(st_as_sf(r4, as_points = FALSE)), main = "rectilinear")
plot(st_geometry((r5)), main = "curvilinear")
```

##  spatiotemporal (S/T) data

* some S/T data has _irregular_ space-time locations, typically in case where the time and location are of primary interest (events): earth quakes, floods, lightning, disease cases, deaths, 
* often, such data is aggregated to counts/frequencies/densities per time period  and by area, either for privacy or for convenience 
* other data is collected at regular space/time combinations (e.g. sensor data, satellite imagery)
* `stars`: a package for raster and vector data cubes, was developed to handle this second case (time instances/periods are identical for all spatial locations/areas)
* a common action is _change_ of spatial/temporal resolution (interpolation/downsampling/aggregation)

## Data concepts

Data are composed of discrete entities ("numbers, bits")

"Real life" is 

* partly discrete (person, house)
* partly less discrete (mountain, flood)
* partly continuous (elevation, air temperature)

https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13658816.2016.1151520 (open access) 

## Data concepts (2)

Higher-level concepts:

* Reference systems: Space $S$, Time $T$, Discrete $D$, Quality $Q$
* Region $R$, Period $P$
* Object, event $D \Rightarrow (S,T) \Rightarrow Q$ (marked point pattern)
* Field, Coverage: $S \Rightarrow Q$, $(S,T) \Rightarrow Q$
* Trajectory: $T \Rightarrow S \Rightarrow Q$
* Aggregation: $(R,P) \Rightarrow Q$

The concept of a _function_ ($\Rightarrow$) is largely absent in GIS or data base representations, and neither is that of aggregations as a type.

## Exercises (2)

* Read the file `system.file("tif/L7_ETMs.tif", package = "stars")` with `stars::read_stars`
* print the dataset, and describe what it contains
* plot the dataset; how are the color breaks chosen?
* find the maximum pixel value for each of the bands (`st_apply`)
* find and plot the maximum reflectance over all bands for all pixels
* find and plot the mean reflectance over all bands for all pixels
* plot the subset of these data with the first 10 rows, the second 10 colums, and the last 3 bands
* use `st_crop` to crop the dataset to the area 300 m around `POINT (293749.5 9115745)`
* is this cropped dataset still a (rectangular) raster?
